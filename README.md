### **Abstract / Executive Summary**

This project presents an end-to-end analytics study of a **US-based ecommerce company** operating in the consumer retail domain. The dataset contains multi-year transactional, customer, fulfillment, and behavioral records used to evaluate business performance across revenue trends, order volume, profitability, discount impact, returns, delivery performance, and customer engagement.

The company serves a nationwide customer base and processes sales activity across multiple product categories and channels. The dataset includes approximately:

- **50,00+ unique customers**
- **100,000+ historical transactions**
- **$25M–$30M+ in recorded sales revenue**
- **Multiple sales and fulfillment channels**
- **Delivery time, returns, discounting & behavioral attributes**

A structured data engineering and analytics workflow was applied using:

- **SQL Server** — data ingestion, staging, transformation, and analytical queries  
- **Excel** — tabular validation, KPI summaries, and heatmap analysis  
- **Power BI** — visual analytics and executive insight storytelling  

The research focuses on deriving actionable insights across:

- revenue and order performance trends  
- product profitability and category contribution  
- discount effectiveness and AOV impact  
- return behavior and financial loss exposure  
- delivery speed and logistics performance  
- customer behavior, frequency, and retention risk  

Insights from this study are intended to support business leaders and operational teams in strategic planning, commercial decision-making, and performance optimization across the ecommerce lifecycle.

### **Background and Problem Context**

The dataset represents operations from a **Ecommerce Retail Company** that sells consumer products across multiple categories and fulfillment channels. Over recent years, the company has experienced rapid digital growth, increasing competition from peer retailers, evolving customer purchasing behavior, and operational challenges related to delivery performance and returns.

The business operates at national scale, serving a large and diverse customer base characterized by:

- high transaction volumes  
- varying order frequency across customers  
- mixed profitability across product categories  
- seasonal fluctuations in demand  
- discount-driven purchasing behavior in certain segments  

Despite having substantial data across sales, customers, fulfillment, and behavioral interactions, business leaders face several analytics and decision-making challenges, including:

- limited visibility into **revenue and order performance trends over time**  
- difficulty identifying **profitable vs. low-margin product categories**  
- uncertainty around the **financial impact of returns and refunds**  
- lack of insight into **delivery delays and logistics bottlenecks**  
- limited understanding of **customer repeat purchase behavior and churn risk**  
- challenges in assessing **regional performance differences across states**  

To address these challenges, this project applies a structured, data-driven analysis to evaluate historical performance, quantify operational risk areas, and generate insights that support **strategic planning, pricing decisions, retention strategy, and operational optimization**.

### 🎯 **Objectives and Research Goals**

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the historical performance of a US-based ecommerce business and generate data-driven insights that support strategic decision-making across revenue growth, profitability, customer retention, and operational efficiency.

The analysis is designed to answer key business questions across the following domains:

**1- Sales & Revenue Performance**
- How have revenue, order volume, and AOV changed over time?
- Which months, seasons, or years exhibit strong or weak performance trends?

**2- Customer Engagement & Retention**
- Which customers generate the highest lifetime revenue?
- What proportion of customers are repeat vs. one-time buyers?
- Are there signs of churn based on inactivity duration?

**3- Product & Category Profitability**
- Which product categories contribute the most revenue and gross profit?
- Which categories have lower margins or higher refund exposure?

**4- Discount & Pricing Impact**
- How do discounted orders compare to non-discounted orders?
- Does discounting increase order frequency or reduce profitability?

**5- Returns & Operational Risk**
- What is the overall return rate and financial loss due to returns?
- Do slower deliveries increase return likelihood?

**6- Logistics & Delivery Performance**
- Which delivery speed categories perform best?
- How delivery delays impact customer behavior and satisfaction?

**7- Geographic Market Insights**
