### **Data Architecture and ETL Workflow**

This project follows a structured data-engineering workflow to ensure accuracy, reliability, and analytical readiness of the ecommerce dataset. The pipeline was designed using a **staging-to-production warehouse pattern**, with data validation checkpoints and referential-integrity controls.

The end-to-end ETL workflow consists of the following stages:

---

#### **Step 1 — Source Data Preparation**

The original dataset was provided as a consolidated **Sales Master Excel file**.  
From this file, three domain-specific extract files were created to support dimensional modeling:

- `dim_customer.csv`
- `dim_product.csv`
- `fact_sales.csv`

Each CSV file contained only relevant attributes for its target table, ensuring clean separation of:

- customer attributes
- product category attributes
- transactional sales facts

---

#### **Step 2 — Data Staging Layer (Raw Imports)**

A dedicated SQL schema (`stg`) was created to store raw imported files.

Staging tables were created with `VARCHAR(MAX)` data types to allow safe ingestion of:

- malformed values
- inconsistent text formats
- unexpected special characters

The following staging tables were implemented:

- `stg.stg_dim_customer`
- `stg.stg_dim_product`
- `stg.stg_fact_sales`

Bulk load operations were performed using `BULK INSERT`, with error handling and logging through an `etl_error_log` table.

This ensured:

- repeatable loading
- transparent failure tracking
- UTF-8 file support

---

#### **Step 3 — Data Quality & Validation Checks**

Before transformation, multiple validation blocks were executed, including:

- missing key detection (Order_ID, Customer_ID, Product_Category)
- duplicate key identification
- gender and loyalty tier distribution review
- blank or null field checks
- date parsing and invalid date detection
- numeric field casting validation
- negative and zero-value anomaly checks
- revenue reconciliation totals

Business-rule validation was also applied, including:

- unit price × quantity − discount vs recorded total
- checking rounding tolerances
- confirming financial consistency across records

This stage served as the **data reliability checkpoint** before promotion to production tables.

---

#### **Step 4 — Production Data Model (Cleaned Tables)**

After validation, data was transformed, standardized, and loaded into structured production tables:

- `dbo.customers` (Customer Dimension)
- `dbo.product_category` (Product Dimension)
- `dbo.sales` (Sales Fact Table)

Transformations included:

- text trimming & normalization
- `TRY_CAST` conversion to numeric and date types
- blank → NULL conversions
- boolean field normalization
- automatic date hierarchy derivation (Year, Month, Quarter, etc.)

Only **cleaned and validated rows** were inserted.

---

#### **Step 5 — Referential Integrity & Warehouse Constraints**

Foreign key relationships were enforced to maintain integrity:

- `sales.Customer_ID` → `customers.Customer_ID`
- `sales.Product_Category` → `product_category.Product_Category`

This ensures:

- no orphaned transaction records
- consistent lookup relationships
- trusted reporting outputs

The final schema follows a **star-schema analytical design**, optimized for:

- SQL analytical queries
- business insight reporting
- Tableau visualization

---

#### **Step 6 — Analytics & Reporting Layer**

The cleaned production tables were connected to:

- **Tableau** → for interactive dashboards and insights
- (optionally) Tableau → for visual exploration and validation

All SQL-based analysis queries were executed on the **production fact & dimension tables**, not on staging data — ensuring high-quality analytical outputs.

---

 This workflow delivers a robust, auditable, and enterprise-style ETL process designed for **data accuracy, performance reliability, and scalable analytics.**

### Methodology & Analytical Approach

This project follows a structured, end-to-end analytics workflow covering dataset preparation, ETL validation, warehouse modeling, analytical querying, and BI-driven storytelling. The methodology ensures that all insights are generated from **clean, validated, and trustworthy data**.

---

####  Phase 1 — Data Preparation & Source Structuring

The project began with a single **Sales Master File** (Excel source).  
To support scalable analytics, the dataset was logically decomposed into:

- **dim_customer.csv** — customer demographics & loyalty info  
- **dim_product.csv** — product category reference table  
- **fact_sales.csv** — transactional sales fact table  

This separation enabled a **star-schema–ready structure** and improved referential integrity.

Each file was designed to include only relevant business attributes to support downstream modeling.

---

####  Phase 2 — Staging Layer & Raw Data Ingestion

A dedicated **staging schema (`stg`)** was created in SQL Server to safely load raw CSV files.

- All fields were first ingested as `VARCHAR(MAX)`  
- BULK INSERT was used with UTF-8 compatibility  
- Error handling and ETL logging were implemented

The staging layer allowed:

- controlled ingestion  
- repeatable re-runs  
- isolation of raw data from production tables  

This ensured that **no unvalidated data** entered the warehouse.

---

####  Phase 3 — Data Quality Validation & Cleansing

A comprehensive validation framework was applied across staging tables, including:

**Customer data checks**
- missing / blank customer keys  
- duplicate customer records  
- loyalty tier distribution review  
- gender & demographic consistency checks  

**Product data checks**
- missing / null product categories  
- duplicate or malformed values  
- distinct category verification  

**Sales transaction controls**
- missing Order_ID / Customer_ID keys  
- invalid or non-parseable dates  
- numeric field validation for price, quantity, totals  
- formula validation for revenue computations  
- identification of negative or zero amounts  

Additional controls ensured:

- financial consistency  
- clean keys and foreign relationships  
- safe handling of edge-case values  

Only validated and corrected records proceeded to DW load.

---

####  Phase 4 — Warehouse Loading & Star-Schema Modeling

Cleaned records were inserted into production tables:

- **customers (Dimension)**
- **product_category (Dimension)**
- **sales (Fact Table)**

Key business attributes included:

- revenue, cost, gross profit & margin  
- discount & markup impact  
- delivery speed & return behavior  
- customer activity & session metrics  
- enriched calendar intelligence fields  

Referential integrity was enforced via:

- **FK_sales_customer**
- **FK_sales_product_category**

This ensured accurate one-to-many relationships across the model.

---

####  Phase 5 — Analytical Querying & KPI Computation

T-SQL was used to compute:

- revenue & order trends
- product profitability & category margins
- retention & returning-customer metrics
- geographic & state-level performance
- discount impact on conversion & AOV
- delivery delays vs return risk
- churn & behavioral indicators

Queries were structured for:

- repeatability  
- performance efficiency  
- analytical transparency  

Intermediate outputs were validated in Excel where necessary.

---

####  Phase 6 — Visualization & Insight Storytelling

Power BI was connected directly to the SQL warehouse to ensure:

- live query execution  
- reliable single-source-of-truth metrics  

Dashboards were designed to highlight:

- business-focused narratives  
- operational risk indicators  
- profitability opportunities  
- retention & return exposure patterns  

Visuals emphasized:

- clarity
- decision relevance
- executive interpretability

---

Overall, this methodology ensured that insights were generated through a **disciplined, auditable, and enterprise-aligned analytics process**, rather than through simple reporting or ad-hoc querying.

### **Sales Performance — Key Insights (Evidence-Based)**

-Total recorded revenue is approximately $281.5M.
Revenue peaks in 2023, followed by a gradual decline in 2024–2025, indicating a post-growth normalization period.

-Electronics is the largest revenue contributor (~$135M).
It also has the highest AOV ($5K+), meaning the category is driven by fewer but higher-value premium transactions.

-Sports, Fashion, and Books generate high order volume but lower AOV.
These categories act as volume drivers, contributing strongly to transaction count but moderately to revenue share.

-Clear seasonal demand cycles are visible across multiple years.
Revenue spikes occur during mid-year and year-end periods, reflecting strong response to retail campaigns and promotions.

-2025 indicates emerging demand slowdown signals.
Annual order volume declines from 56K (2023) → 46K (2024) → 33K (2025), suggesting reduced purchasing frequency and potential retention risk.

-AOV remains stable at ~$1.28K despite order decline.
This confirms performance impact is volume-driven, not caused by discount erosion or ticket-size reduction.

---

### **Customer Behavior & Retention — Key Insights (Evidence-Based)**

-Customer base is driven primarily by loyal & repeat buyers.
3,926 customers fall into the High-Frequency (20+ purchases) segment, indicating a strong cohort of habitual repeat shoppers forming the financial backbone of the business.

-A small segment contributes disproportionately high lifetime value (Top-20 Customers insight).
Highest value customers generate $400K–$900K lifetime revenue each, with AOV ranging $4K–$25K, confirming the presence of premium, price-insensitive buyers.

-RFM distribution shows strong recency & purchasing activity.
Many top-value customers have recency between 1–20 days, meaning core customers remain actively engaged and currently purchasing.

-New customer acquisition is heavily front-loaded in early months.
Customer onboarding peaked in early 2021 (2152 in one cohort month) and steadily declined over time — indicating lower new-user acquisition in later periods.

-Later acquisition cohorts show very small customer inflow.
Monthly new-customer counts fall to single digits after late 2023, signaling acquisition slowdown and possible market saturation.

-Repeat purchase strength offsets new-customer decline.
Despite falling acquisition, a large repeat-buyer population suggests strong customer stickiness and relationship value.

-Medium-frequency customers represent upgrade opportunities.
1,067 customers sit in the 6–20 purchase group, representing the most viable group for upsell, loyalty, and targeted retention programs.

-Churn risk is emerging from inactive or aging cohorts.
Some high-value customers show recency gaps exceeding 90–120+ days, highlighting a segment requiring win-back & re-engagement strategies.

### 🟡 Query 9 — Profitability by Product Category (Gross Profit & Margin%)

**Purpose** — Identify high-margin and low-margin product categories.

**Business Question** 
Which product categories contribute most to gross profit and margin efficiency?

```sql
SELECT 
    p.Product_Category,
    SUM(s.Gross_Profit) AS gross_profit,
    SUM(s.Total_Amount) AS revenue,
    CASE WHEN SUM(s.Total_Amount) = 0 THEN NULL
         ELSE CAST(SUM(s.Gross_Profit) * 100.0 / SUM(s.Total_Amount) AS DECIMAL(6,2))
    END AS profit_margin_pct
FROM dbo.sales s
JOIN dbo.product_category p 
    ON s.Product_Category = p.Product_Category
GROUP BY p.Product_Category
ORDER BY profit_margin_pct DESC;
```

### 🟡 Query 11 — Returns & Loss Impact — Product Category Level

**Purpose** — Quantify financial leakage from returned orders.

**Business Question** 
What percentage of orders are returned and how much revenue is lost?

```sql
SELECT 
    p.Product_Category,

    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,

    SUM(CASE WHEN s.Return_Flag = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS returns_count,

    CAST(
        100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN s.Return_Flag = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
        / COUNT(*)
        AS DECIMAL(6,2)
    ) AS return_rate_pct,

    SUM(CASE WHEN s.Return_Flag = 1 THEN s.Total_Amount ELSE 0 END) AS return_value

---

### **Product Performance — Key Insights (Evidence-Based)**

-Beauty is the most profitable category
**Highest margin 36.24%, but also among the highest return exposure (13%+)** — indicates premium positioning but post-purchase dissatisfaction risk.

-Sports delivers strong unit economics
High profit margin **30.96% with low return rate (~3–4%)** — strongest risk-adjusted profitability contributor.

-Electronics is high-revenue but discount-dependent
Margin **25.68% while 66%** of orders are discounted, meaning revenue strength is promotion-driven rather than organic demand.

-Food is the weakest financial performer
Lowest margin 4.38% — signals price compression, high cost base, or operational inefficiency.

-Returns are concentrated in Beauty & Books
Both categories report >**13% return rate vs portfolio baseline (~3–4%)** — creates disproportionate refund and loss impact.

-Fashion, Toys & Sports act as volume engines
High order throughput with stable return risk, supporting scale and transaction growth.

-Demand is highly price-elastic
66% of total orders are discount-led, confirming performance is promotion-sensitive across most categories.

##  Channel & Engagement — Key Insights (Evidence-Backed)

-Online & Mobile App channels dominate revenue contribution
Online contributes **$123.7M (highest revenue)** followed by Mobile App at **$100.6M** — confirming that digital channels are the primary commercial drivers, while Retail Store and B2B remain secondary channels.

-Strong multichannel demand but value concentration in digital
Retail Store & B2B generate meaningful order volumes, however revenue contribution remains significantly lower — indicating lower-value or transactional purchase behavior in these channels.

-Engagement is highest on Mobile devices despite similar session length
Mobile users account for **114K+ orders** compared to Desktop (74K) and Tablet (30K), even though session time **averages ~14 mins** across devices — suggesting higher conversion efficiency on Mobile.

-Page-depth patterns indicate stronger browsing behavior on Mobile & Tablet
Mobile & Tablet users average 9 pages/session vs 8 pages on Desktop, implying greater exploration behavior and potential cross-sell opportunities on mobile platforms.

-Weekday demand remains stable with no significant drop-off risk
Orders remain consistently distributed across days — Monday to Saturday **average ~31K orders** each, indicating predictable baseline demand and minimal weekday volatility.

-Sunday shows slightly lower order volume but stable revenue
Sunday orders dip modestly relative to weekdays, but revenue impact remains neutral — suggesting stable AOV rather than basket erosion.

-Longer browsing sessions correlate with higher purchase value
Session buckets **30–35** minutes show the highest AOV **(~$1.5K+)**, confirming that higher engagement duration is linked with stronger purchase intent rather than casual browsing.

-Extremely short & extremely long sessions indicate weak purchase intent
Very **short sessions (~0–5 mins)** and **very long sessions (~40+ mins)** reflect lower AOV, likely representing bounce traffic and abandoned browsing rather than high-value activity.

### 🟡 Query 16 — Delivery Speed vs Returns (Logistics Risk)

**Purpose** — Assess whether slower delivery speeds are associated with higher return likelihood.

**Business Question**
Do delayed shipments increase product return probability?

```sql

SELECT 
    Delivery_Speed_Category,
    COUNT(*) AS orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Return_Flag = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS returns,
    CAST(
        100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Return_Flag = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)
        AS DECIMAL(6,2)
    ) AS return_rate_pct
FROM dbo.sales
GROUP BY Delivery_Speed_Category
ORDER BY return_rate_pct DESC;

### 🟡 Query 17 — Delivery Fulfillment Speed Buckets (Operational Exposure)

**Purpose** — To evaluate how order volume is distributed across delivery speed ranges, identify slow-fulfillment exposure, and highlight operational risk in orders taking more than 10 days to deliver.

**Business Question**
How many orders fall into each delivery time bucket, and what proportion of total orders are being fulfilled within acceptable delivery windows versus slow or delayed delivery windows?


```sql

WITH delivery_buckets AS (
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 0 AND 3 THEN '0–3 Days'
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 4 AND 7 THEN '4–7 Days'
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 8 AND 10 THEN '8–10 Days'
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 11 AND 15 THEN '11–15 Days'
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 16 AND 20 THEN '16–20 Days'
            ELSE '20+ Days'
        END AS delivery_bucket,
        Customer_Rating,
        Delivery_Time_Days
    FROM dbo.sales
)
SELECT 
    delivery_bucket,
    COUNT(*) AS orders,
    AVG(Customer_Rating) AS avg_rating,
    AVG(Delivery_Time_Days) AS avg_delivery_days
FROM delivery_buckets
GROUP BY delivery_bucket
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '0–3 Days' THEN 1
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '4–7 Days' THEN 2
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '8–10 Days' THEN 3
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '11–15 Days' THEN 4
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '16–20 Days' THEN 5
        ELSE 6
    END;

### Delivery & CX — Key Insights (Evidence-Based)

**Order volume is concentrated in the 4–7 day delivery window**
**81,871 orders (≈40% of total volume)** fall in this bucket, indicating this is the primary logistics SLA used across the network.

**Ultra-fast (0–3 days) delivery accounts for 66,123 orders (~32%)**
This suggests a strong dependency on express fulfillment capacity, which likely drives higher logistics cost exposure.

**Deliveries exceeding 10 days form a visible long-tail risk segment**
34,122 (8–10 days) + 25,668 (11–15 days) + 8,252 (16–20 days) + 3,964 (20+ days)
→ **collectively 72,000+ delayed orders (~35% of total)**
representing potential experience degradation & retention risk.

**Slow deliveries show materially higher return probability**
Return rate = 6.82% for Slow vs ≈2% for Fast & Medium
confirming that delivery latency is a key CX failure driver, not product quality.

**Ratings remain flat across delivery buckets (avg = 3.0)**
This implies customers do not immediately reflect delivery pain in ratings,
reinforcing that returns & churn signals are stronger risk indicators than ratings.

**Most operational exposure sits between 8–15 days**
59,790 orders in these buckets indicate a systemic mid-tier logistics bottleneck
→ likely tied to regional routing or inventory transfer lag.

**20+ day orders represent a critical escalation zone**
3,964 cases constitute a CX incident-level segment requiring
customer recovery workflows (refund credit / proactive outreach).
