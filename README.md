### **Executive Summary**

This project presents an end-to-end analytics study of a **US-based ecommerce company** operating in the consumer retail domain. The dataset contains multi-year transactional, customer, fulfillment, and behavioral records used to evaluate business performance across revenue trends, order volume, profitability, discount impact, returns, delivery performance, and customer engagement.

The research focuses on deriving actionable insights across:

This project is designed around the core ecommerce questions that business stakeholders and leadership teams typically care about:

**Revenue Growth & Demand Trends** — How sales volume and revenue evolve over time, and where growth or slowdown signals emerge

**Category & Product Profitability** — Which product groups drive profit vs volume, and where margin leakage occurs

**Customer Value & Retention Health** — Which customers generate repeat revenue, where churn risk appears, and how purchasing behavior shifts over time

**Price Sensitivity & Discount Dependency** — How discounts influence conversion, order value, and long-term revenue quality

**Returns & Financial Risk Exposure** — Which segments experience higher return rates and associated loss impact

**Delivery Performance & Experience Risk** — Where slow delivery correlates with operational friction or customer risk pockets

**Market & Geographic Concentration** — Which cities and states contribute most to revenue and profitability

Insights from this study are intended to support business leaders and operational teams in strategic planning, commercial decision-making, and performance optimization across the ecommerce lifecycle.

### **Data Preparation & Analytical Dataset Workflow**

The dataset was prepared to support decision-focused ecommerce analysis and reporting.
The final analytical model was structured into three validated tables:

**Customers** — acquisition, activity, repeat-purchase behavior

**Product Categories** — merchandise performance grouping

**Sales Transactions** — revenue, order value, discounts, returns

During preparation, the data was:

- reviewed for gaps, duplicates, and structural inconsistencies

- reconciled against financial totals to avoid misleading insights

- standardized into analysis-ready fields (dates, categories, KPIs)

- Only records that passed validation were promoted into the analytical layer.

The result is a clean, reliable dataset designed to answer real business questions, including:

- which products and markets drive revenue concentration

- how customer retention and purchase frequency evolve over time

- where operational risk appears in delivery, returns, or discounts

This ensures that every insight in the project is evidence-based, decision-relevant, and defensible to stakeholders.

---

### **Sales Performance**

-Total recorded revenue is approximately $281.5M.
Revenue peaks in 2023, followed by a gradual decline in 2024–2025, indicating a post-growth normalization period.

-Electronics is the largest revenue contributor (~$135M).
It also has the highest AOV ($5K+), meaning the category is driven by fewer but higher-value premium transactions.

-Sports, Fashion, and Books generate high order volume but lower AOV.
These categories act as volume drivers, contributing strongly to transaction count but moderately to revenue share.

-Clear seasonal demand cycles are visible across multiple years.
Revenue spikes occur during mid-year and year-end periods, reflecting strong response to retail campaigns and promotions.

-2025 indicates emerging demand slowdown signals.
Annual order volume declines from 56K (2023) → 46K (2024) → 33K (2025), suggesting reduced purchasing frequency and potential retention risk.

-AOV remains stable at ~$1.28K despite order decline.
This confirms performance impact is volume-driven, not caused by discount erosion or ticket-size reduction.

### **Customer Behavior & Retention — Key Insights**

-Customer base is driven primarily by loyal & repeat buyers.
3,926 customers fall into the High-Frequency (20+ purchases) segment, indicating a strong cohort of habitual repeat shoppers forming the financial backbone of the business.

-A small segment contributes disproportionately high lifetime value (Top-20 Customers insight).
Highest value customers generate $400K–$900K lifetime revenue each, with AOV ranging $4K–$25K, confirming the presence of premium, price-insensitive buyers.

-RFM distribution shows strong recency & purchasing activity.
Many top-value customers have recency between 1–20 days, meaning core customers remain actively engaged and currently purchasing.

-New customer acquisition is heavily front-loaded in early months.
Customer onboarding peaked in early 2021 (2152 in one cohort month) and steadily declined over time — indicating lower new-user acquisition in later periods.

-Later acquisition cohorts show very small customer inflow.
Monthly new-customer counts fall to single digits after late 2023, signaling acquisition slowdown and possible market saturation.

-Repeat purchase strength offsets new-customer decline.
Despite falling acquisition, a large repeat-buyer population suggests strong customer stickiness and relationship value.

-Medium-frequency customers represent upgrade opportunities.
1,067 customers sit in the 6–20 purchase group, representing the most viable group for upsell, loyalty, and targeted retention programs.

-Churn risk is emerging from inactive or aging cohorts.
Some high-value customers show recency gaps exceeding 90–120+ days, highlighting a segment requiring win-back & re-engagement strategies.

    SUM(s.Total_Amount) AS revenue,
    CASE WHEN SUM(s.Total_Amount) = 0 THEN NULL
         ELSE CAST(SUM(s.Gross_Profit) * 100.0 / SUM(s.Total_Amount) AS DECIMAL(6,2))
    END AS profit_margin_pct
FROM dbo.sales s
JOIN dbo.product_category p 
    ON s.Product_Category = p.Product_Category
GROUP BY p.Product_Category
ORDER BY profit_margin_pct DESC;
```

    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,

    SUM(CASE WHEN s.Return_Flag = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS returns_count,

    CAST(
        100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN s.Return_Flag = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
        / COUNT(*)
        AS DECIMAL(6,2)
    ) AS return_rate_pct,

    SUM(CASE WHEN s.Return_Flag = 1 THEN s.Total_Amount ELSE 0 END) AS return_value

---

### **Product Performance — Key Insights**

-Beauty is the most profitable category
**Highest margin 36.24%, but also among the highest return exposure (13%+)** — indicates premium positioning but post-purchase dissatisfaction risk.

-Sports delivers strong unit economics
High profit margin **30.96% with low return rate (~3–4%)** — strongest risk-adjusted profitability contributor.

-Electronics is high-revenue but discount-dependent
Margin **25.68% while 66%** of orders are discounted, meaning revenue strength is promotion-driven rather than organic demand.

-Food is the weakest financial performer
Lowest margin 4.38% — signals price compression, high cost base, or operational inefficiency.

-Returns are concentrated in Beauty & Books
Both categories report >**13% return rate vs portfolio baseline (~3–4%)** — creates disproportionate refund and loss impact.

-Fashion, Toys & Sports act as volume engines
High order throughput with stable return risk, supporting scale and transaction growth.

-Demand is highly price-elastic
66% of total orders are discount-led, confirming performance is promotion-sensitive across most categories.

</p>

---

## ** Channel & Engagement — Key Insights**

-Online & Mobile App channels dominate revenue contribution
Online contributes **$123.7M (highest revenue)** followed by Mobile App at **$100.6M** — confirming that digital channels are the primary commercial drivers, while Retail Store and B2B remain secondary channels.

-Strong multichannel demand but value concentration in digital
Retail Store & B2B generate meaningful order volumes, however revenue contribution remains significantly lower — indicating lower-value or transactional purchase behavior in these channels.

-Engagement is highest on Mobile devices despite similar session length
Mobile users account for **114K+ orders** compared to Desktop (74K) and Tablet (30K), even though session time **averages ~14 mins** across devices — suggesting higher conversion efficiency on Mobile.

-Page-depth patterns indicate stronger browsing behavior on Mobile & Tablet
Mobile & Tablet users average 9 pages/session vs 8 pages on Desktop, implying greater exploration behavior and potential cross-sell opportunities on mobile platforms.

-Weekday demand remains stable with no significant drop-off risk
Orders remain consistently distributed across days — Monday to Saturday **average ~31K orders** each, indicating predictable baseline demand and minimal weekday volatility.

-Sunday shows slightly lower order volume but stable revenue
Sunday orders dip modestly relative to weekdays, but revenue impact remains neutral — suggesting stable AOV rather than basket erosion.

-Longer browsing sessions correlate with higher purchase value
Session buckets **30–35** minutes show the highest AOV **(~$1.5K+)**, confirming that higher engagement duration is linked with stronger purchase intent rather than casual browsing.

-Extremely short & extremely long sessions indicate weak purchase intent
Very **short sessions (~0–5 mins)** and **very long sessions (~40+ mins)** reflect lower AOV, likely representing bounce traffic and abandoned browsing rather than high-value activity.

**Business Question**
How many orders fall into each delivery time bucket, and what proportion of total orders are being fulfilled within acceptable delivery windows versus slow or delayed delivery windows?


```sql

WITH delivery_buckets AS (
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 0 AND 3 THEN '0–3 Days'
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 4 AND 7 THEN '4–7 Days'
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 8 AND 10 THEN '8–10 Days'
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 11 AND 15 THEN '11–15 Days'
            WHEN Delivery_Time_Days BETWEEN 16 AND 20 THEN '16–20 Days'
            ELSE '20+ Days'
        END AS delivery_bucket,
        Customer_Rating,
        Delivery_Time_Days
    FROM dbo.sales
)
SELECT 
    delivery_bucket,
    COUNT(*) AS orders,
    AVG(Customer_Rating) AS avg_rating,
    AVG(Delivery_Time_Days) AS avg_delivery_days
FROM delivery_buckets
GROUP BY delivery_bucket
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '0–3 Days' THEN 1
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '4–7 Days' THEN 2
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '8–10 Days' THEN 3
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '11–15 Days' THEN 4
        WHEN delivery_bucket = '16–20 Days' THEN 5
        ELSE 6
    END;

### **Delivery & CX — Key Insights**

**Order volume is concentrated in the 4–7 day delivery window**
**81,871 orders (≈40% of total volume)** fall in this bucket, indicating this is the primary logistics SLA used across the network.

**Ultra-fast (0–3 days) delivery accounts for 66,123 orders (~32%)**
This suggests a strong dependency on express fulfillment capacity, which likely drives higher logistics cost exposure.

**Deliveries exceeding 10 days form a visible long-tail risk segment**
34,122 (8–10 days) + 25,668 (11–15 days) + 8,252 (16–20 days) + 3,964 (20+ days)
→ **collectively 72,000+ delayed orders (~35% of total)**
representing potential experience degradation & retention risk.

**Slow deliveries show materially higher return probability**
Return rate = 6.82% for Slow vs ≈2% for Fast & Medium
confirming that delivery latency is a key CX failure driver, not product quality.

**Ratings remain flat across delivery buckets (avg = 3.0)**
This implies customers do not immediately reflect delivery pain in ratings,
reinforcing that returns & churn signals are stronger risk indicators than ratings.

**Most operational exposure sits between 8–15 days**
59,790 orders in these buckets indicate a systemic mid-tier logistics bottleneck
→ likely tied to regional routing or inventory transfer lag.

**20+ day orders represent a critical escalation zone**
3,964 cases constitute a CX incident-level segment requiring
customer recovery workflows (refund credit / proactive outreach).

### 🟡 Query 18 — Orders & Revenue Contribution by City & State

**Purpose** — Identify high-revenue markets and regional demand concentration.

**Business Question**
Which cities and states generate the highest order volume and revenue contribution across the portfolio?

```sql

SELECT 
    c.City,
    c.State,
    COUNT(*) AS orders,
    SUM(s.Total_Amount) AS revenue
FROM dbo.sales s
JOIN dbo.customers c 
    ON s.Customer_ID = c.Customer_ID
GROUP BY c.City, c.State
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

### 🟡 Query 19 — Profit Margin Performance by State

**Purpose** — Assess geographic profitability and operating efficiency variation.

**Business Question**
Which states are highly profitable vs cost-intensive, based on gross profit margin contribution?

```sql

SELECT 
    c.State,
    SUM(s.Gross_Profit) AS gross_profit,
    SUM(s.Total_Amount) AS revenue,
    CAST(
        100.0 * SUM(s.Gross_Profit) / SUM(s.Total_Amount)
        AS DECIMAL(6,2)
    ) AS profit_margin_pct
FROM dbo.sales s
JOIN dbo.customers c 
    ON s.Customer_ID = c.Customer_ID
GROUP BY c.State
ORDER BY profit_margin_pct DESC;
```

### **Geographic Performance — Key Insights**

**Revenue leadership is highly concentrated in a few metro hubs.**
New York City alone contributes **$72.86M** in revenue across **56.9K** orders, making it the single largest commercial market.
Chicago **($38.14M)** and Los Angeles **($35.02M)** follow as secondary revenue centers, forming a Tier-1 urban performance cluster.

**California appears as a dual-engine revenue driver at the city level.**
Los Angeles ($35.0M) and San Francisco ($21.15M) together generate $56M+ revenue, reinforcing California’s position as a strategic premium consumer market.

**Atlanta and Boston exhibit strong mid-market performance.**
Despite lower order volumes vs Tier-1 cities, both deliver $21M–$30M revenue, indicating healthy demand density outside major population hubs.

**Texas markets show balanced commercial strength rather than spiky concentration.**
Dallas **($19.6M)** and Austin **($17.29M)** jointly contribute **$36.9M** revenue, suggesting distributed economic activity rather than single-city dominance.

**West-coast secondary markets demonstrate healthy profitability positioning.**
Seattle generates **$13.84M** revenue across 10.9K orders, aligning with higher-value but moderate-volume urban spending patterns.

**State-level profitability leaders indicate operational & pricing advantages.**
Massachusetts **(25.05%), Illinois (25.03%), and Texas (24.82%)** report the highest gross margin performance, suggesting
— lower discount reliance,
— stronger product mix, and
— healthier cost-to-revenue leverage.

**Lower-margin states still maintain strong revenue bases.**
California (24.71%) and New York (24.75%) remain highly profitable despite volume intensity, meaning margin pressure is controlled and structurally resilient
